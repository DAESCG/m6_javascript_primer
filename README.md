Meeting Synopsis
----------------
The first half of the meeting featured a JavaScript (JS) primer. Dan Panzarella
led the primer, which covered basic JS syntax and usage. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
was used to carry out most JS demonstrations, but the [web console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console)
was also utilized.

The focus of the meeting switched to [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) following
the JS primer. Kevin Tyle provided more Leaflet demonstrations and stepped through
associated source code.
